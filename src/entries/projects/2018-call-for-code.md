Obtained Semifinalist Certificate out of 100k+ developers and 156 nations by developing an [API](https://github.com/Contact-Platform/Contact/tree/master/API) to help [CONTACT](https://github.com/Contact-Platform/Contact) understand what their users were saying with Watson AI and the IBM Cloud. I also built a [landing page](https://contact-app.mybluemix.net/) with: Tailwind CSS, Leaflet, D3.js, Chart.js, and Node.js (Express.js).
